                    <i>“A few interviewees hinted at a higher purpose by explicitly stating that they were not motivated by money, but by wanting to utilize their past experience in a career where they would have the opportunity to effect progressive change in organizational cultures.” (Greene, A., & Kirton, G, 2024) </i>

                    <b>Anti – Racism: It’s Not a Grey Area</b>
                </p>
                <p>As a College community, we have a responsibility to stand up, and speak out against racism in all it’s forms. Even within campus we’re not immune to systematic racism and unconscious bias that continues to be prevalent and still exist within our classrooms, hallways and meeting rooms. That is why we must do more.</p>
                <p>Committing to anti-racism is committing to action.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Anti-Racism Action Committee – made up of volunteers from all around the college and helps integrate anti-racist sentiments.</li>
                    <li>Anti-racism - is a conscious choice – it’s not the absence of racism, but rather the decision to actively condemn racism and recognize the impact it has on the people around us. There is no room for racism in any of our spaces and everyone is held with the same expectation to respect all people.</li>
                    <li>Institutional racism – is racism that is woven into policies and functions at the organizational and governmental levels – which affects people and opportunities broadly and to varying degrees.</li>
                    <li>Intersectionality – is recognizing how the identities of an individual can affect their experiences in different ways, particularly in matters that are impacted by discrimination.</li>
