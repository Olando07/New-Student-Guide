                </p>
                <p>At RRC Polytech, we all have a responsibility to stand up, and speak out against racism in all it’s forms. Even within the campus we are not immune to racism and any unconscious bias that continues to persist and still exist within our community whether it be in the classrooms or hallways of our institution. That is why we must do more. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Anti-Racism Action Committee – made up of volunteers from all around the college and helps integrate anti-racist sentiments. </li>
                    <li>Anti-racism – is a conscious choice to decide for yourself to actively refuse to condone racism, recognizing its impact on the people around us. </li>
                    <li>Institutional racism – policies and functions woven into institutions which can affect people opportunities to varying degrees. </li>
                    <li>Intersectionality – recognize how someone's identity may affect their experiences, in matters regarding discrimination. </li>
